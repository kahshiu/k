github actions
- Notes
- can run in matrixes, in parallel, and can control max_parallel
- include, exclude params
- continue on error - even when a step fails, it will still turn out success
- fail-fast - when one parallel job encounter error, the rest will off immediately. 
  - Default behaviour is true, 
  - Turn to false if parallel jobs should continue despite one hits error
- set jobs prerequisite - needs
- set jobs output/ set step output

- can run in containers instead of os
